const aboutInfo = `My name is Vladimir and I am a professional embedded software engineer. I have a masters's degree in informatics from the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. I primarily work on compilers, mostly using the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. Some of the tasks I worked on included writing and modifying optimization passes, optimizing the backend for proprietary targets and writing a custom clang-based static analysis tool. Aside from that, I have also developed web (MEAN, MERN stack), desktop (C++) and Android (Java) applications by myself and in a group environment. My hobbies include tinkering with electronics (ESP32, FPGAs, Arduino and Raspberry Pi) and Game Development.`;
